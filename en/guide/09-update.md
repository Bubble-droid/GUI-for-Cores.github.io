# Update

## Update Normally

1. Windows and GNU/Linux

Go to the `Settings` - `About`, click on the version number to check for updates

1. macOS

Backup the data folder, delete the application, and follow the steps in [Installation](/en/guide/01-install)

## Rolling-Release

Go to the `Settings` page, turn on `Enable Rolling Release`, install the `滚动发行` plugin, run the plugin to update the application

## Comparison of the Two Update Methods

Update normally is not user-friendly on macOS, but the experience is better on Windows and GNU/Linux. However, the download size is larger than Rolling Release, and it can be slower if the network connection is poor

Rolling Release is user-friendly on all three platforms and supports automatic updates. It provides faster, newer and more stable GUI experience

Note: Rolling Release is only supported by `GUI.for.Clash v1.8.2` and `GUI.for.SingBox v1.8.1` or later, and `Enable Rolling Release` must be turned on, the `滚动发行` plugin must be installed
